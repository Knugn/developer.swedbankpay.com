body="Direct Invoice is about to be phased out. This section is only for
merchants that currently have a contract with this integration." %}

{% include jumbotron.html body="**Direct** is a payment service where Swedbank
Pay helps improve cashflow by purchasing merchant invoices. Swedbank Pay
receives invoice data, which is used to produce and distribute invoices to the
consumer/end-user" %}

## Introduction

1. Collect all purchase information and send it in a `POST` request to Swedbank
   Pay.
1. Include personal information (SSN and postal code) and send it to Swedbank
   Pay.
1. Make a new `POST` request towards Swedbank Pay to retrieve the name and
   address of the customer.
1. Create an authorization transaction by calculating the final price / amount.
1. Make a third `POST` request with consumer data as input.
1. Send a  `GET` request with the `paymentID` to get the authorization result
1. Make a Capture by creating a `POST` request

  **By making a Capture, Swedbank Pay will generate
  the invoice to the consumer and the order is ready for shipping.**

## Options before posting a payment

All valid options when posting a payment with operation equal to
`FinancingConsumer`, are described in
[other features][financing-consumer].

* An invoice payment is always two-phased based - you create an Authorize
  transaction, that is followed by a `Capture` or `Cancel` request.

{% include alert-callback-url.md payment_instrument="invoice" %}

{% include alert.html type="neutral" icon="info" body="
Note that the invoice will not be created/distributed before you have
made a `capture` request." %}.

The `Capture` , `Cancel`, `Reversal` opions are
described in [other features][other-features].
The links will take you directly to the API description for the specific request.

The sequence diagram below shows a high level description of the invoice
process, including the four requests you have to send to Swedbank Pay to create
an authorize transaction for Sweden (SE) and Norway (NO). Note that for Finland
(FI) the process is different as the Merchant needs to send a `POST` request
with the `approvedLegalAddress` (SNN and postal number).

### Operations

The operations should be performed as described in each response and not as
described here in the documentation.
Always use the `href` and `method` as specified in the response by finding
the appropriate operation based on its `rel` value.
The only thing that should be hard coded in the client is the value of
the `rel` and the request that will be sent in the HTTP body of the request
for the given operation.

| Operation                | Description                                                                                                               |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `update-payment-abort`   | [Aborts][abort] the payment order before any financial transactions are performed.                                        |
| `redirect-authorization` | Contains the URI that is used to redirect the consumer to the Swedbank Pay Payments containing the card authorization UI. |
| `view-authorization`     | Contains the JavaScript `href` that is used to embed  the card authorization UI directly on the webshop/merchant site     |
| `create-capture`         | Creates a `capture` transaction in order to charge the reserved funds from the consumer.                                  |
| `create-cancellation`    | Creates a `cancellation` transaction that cancels a created, but not yet captured payment.                                |

If a `GET` method is used from payment UI  with a `paymentToken`, the following
operations can be returned, depending on state of the payment and the last
transaction.

    {
        "href": "https://example.com/cancelUrl",
